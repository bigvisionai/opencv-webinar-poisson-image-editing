# OpenCV Webinar on Poisson Image Editing

In this webinar, we will discuss about an interesting Image Blending technique called [**Seamless Cloning**](https://learnopencv.com/seamless-cloning-using-opencv-python-cpp/) which is based on [**Poisson Image Editing**](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf)

[**You can open the notebook on Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bigvisionai/opencv-webinar-poisson-image-editing/blob/main/Seamless_Cloning.ipynb)

We will take the learning further by building a Blemish Removal application where you can get rid of any blemishes just by clicking on it.

### Instructions for running the blemish removal application

1. Clone or Download the current repository
2. [Install opencv](https://learnopencv.com/opencv-installation-on-ubuntu-macos-windows-and-raspberry-pi/)
3. Run the following command from inside the folder

```
python removeBlemish.py
```
